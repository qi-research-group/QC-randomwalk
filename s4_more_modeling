% so the H+, with positive gradient, 'explores' cyclically in higher state
% regimes. The H-, with negative gradient, 'explores state space cyclically
% in lower state regimes.

% the initial state sets the bar of this exploration. Cyclical 'energy'
% likely still is maintained in the imaginary component, so I don't know
% how alternating H+ and H- will play into this.

% lets explore offset and slope of gradients.
